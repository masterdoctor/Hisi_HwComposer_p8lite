# HiSilicon Hardware Composer | Huawei P8-Lite
Custom Hardware Composer for the Huawei P8-Lite

## Current State
It's basically just a P8-Lite version of XePeleato's hardware composer.
I mean at the moment, it literally does nothing.

This should load fine on any P8-Lite device

## Credit
I've had a look at XePeleato's source but I'm coding mine from scratch but I suppose I'm now proxy-influenced by Giagnard's DRM HwComposer and CodeAurora's one.

## Contributions
If you are familiar with C++ (because I'm not really that good), you can absolutely collaborate.

## Forking?
Forks welcome but please, if you use it in your ROM, link somewhere to this GitHub repo.
